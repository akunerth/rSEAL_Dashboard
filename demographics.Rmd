KGender <- ggplot(data = testdata, aes(x=SEAL.C1.DERI.002)) + geom_bar(show.legend=TRUE, fill=c("light blue","light pink"), colour="black")+ labs(caption = "SEAL Test Data", x = "Child Gender", y = "Total Children")

Test of demographic data using SEAL data to date.

  - Working on getting a legend and labels added to charts
  
  - Once charts are good, intend to put basic demographics:
  
      - Gender, Race, Age, Education, Income Level
  
  - Need to call file with source(here), store data outside source folder, and switch from wide to long based on time variable (?), aggregate or gather commands may work...

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(KGender)
plot(CGRace)
```
